## Contributing & Attribution

This project is primarily for personal use, so I don’t expect others to run it as-is. That said, if you’d like to fork or deploy it yourself, you’re welcome to do so — provided you include my name in your source code **and** add visible attribution on your site (in the footer or on the home/about page).

Pull requests and suggestions are also welcome.  
For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you’d like to propose.

_For those visiting early: this site originally ran on a custom Flask CMS with JWT-based authentication. While it was a great learning experience, the ongoing maintenance of a fully custom backend became too heavy. I’ve since migrated to Payload CMS to reduce overhead and focus more on content and features._
